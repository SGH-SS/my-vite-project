- Candle selection functionality (select candles for further analysis)

Data Dashboard :
{
    - When selecting a candle I should be able to click anywhere on the candle not just the box on the left

} 

Vector Dashboard :
{
    - Cant select candles
    - Candles are numbered and hard to diffrentiate, numbered #1-#20?
    - Can only load 20 candles at a time, not able to change 
    - Clicking on a box in the vector visualization heatmap does not give more info on that box

} 

Chart Dashboard :
{
    - no select candle ability

} 

LLM Dashboard :
{
    - llm itself has jackall backend  <-- llamaindex / LangChain layer --> (put hf model ontop of the vectors nigga) & (put gpt/claude api ontop of vecotrs)
    - clean up front end once backend is more solid

} 


- need to perfect this trading dashboard with features ai suggests, implements, and perfects
- look at new cursor additions (background, bugbot, tiktok saved, etc)
